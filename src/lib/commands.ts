Respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact shape, no other text, no markdown fences:
{
  "changes": [
    { "path": "Folder/Note.md", "action": "create" | "update", "content": "...FULL file content..." },
    { "action": "move", "from": "Old/Path.md", "to": "New/Path.md" },
    { "action": "delete", "path": "Folder/Obsolete.md" }
  ],
  "log_entry": "one short paragraph describing what was done and why, for the operations log",
  "summary": "one sentence summary for the UI"
}
As the vault's caretaker you may also reorganize it, not just write notes:
- "move" renames or relocates a note (e.g. file a stray note into the right folder, rename to match
  conventions). Optionally include "content" to also rewrite it during the move.
- "delete" removes a note (use sparingly — only for clear duplicates or explicitly obsolete notes).
- To move INFORMATION from note A to note B: emit an "update" for B with the merged content AND an
  "update" for A with the moved section removed (or a "delete" of A if it becomes empty).
Every change is shown to the user as a reviewable diff before anything is written — propose freely.
When updating an existing file, return its FULL new content, not a diff.
Follow the vault's AI-first rules. Each note's "content" MUST be structured in this exact order:
1. YAML frontmatter as the very FIRST thing — real YAML between "---" fences (NOT inside a markdown code block),
   e.g. starting literally with a line of "---". Include fields like date, type, tags, related-people,
   related-projects, confidence.
2. A "## For future Claude" section: 2-3 plain-English sentences summarizing the note.
3. The note body, using [[wikilinks]] for any person/project/client referenced, with recency markers and
   confidence levels where relevant.
Only state facts present in the user's input or the retrieved context — do NOT invent emails, names, or details.`
