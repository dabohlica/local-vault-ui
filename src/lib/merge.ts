// Re-anchor proposed UPDATES on the real, full current note so the model merges
// into existing knowledge instead of rewriting the whole file from the partial
// fragments it saw during retrieval. The first pass (curate/ingest/command) decides
// WHICH notes to touch and drafts content from limited context; here we take each
// update to a file that already exists, load its FULL content as the authoritative
// base, and ask the model to integrate the proposed content into it — preserving
// everything that still holds, adding what's new, and changing only what's
// contradicted. The result is reviewed as a diff, so the user sees a focused
// add/update rather than a wholesale replacement.

const MERGE_SYSTEM = `You are merging new information into an EXISTING Obsidian note, fully locally. You are given the
note's CURRENT full content (the authoritative base) and PROPOSED content drafted from new input. Produce
ONE merged note.

Rules:
- PRESERVE every existing detail that still holds — keep it essentially verbatim, including the YAML
  frontmatter, the "## For future Claude" preamble, all sections, lists, and [[wikilinks]]. Never drop or
  water down content the new input doesn't actually touch.
- ADD genuinely new facts into the most relevant existing section (or a new section if none fits).
- UPDATE only the specific statements the new input changes or contradicts. Correct them in place; when a
  fact is superseded, fix it and keep the surrounding context. Do not delete unrelated information.
- Do NOT invent anything. Use only the current note and the proposed content.
- Keep the AI-first structure: frontmatter first, then "## For future Claude", then body. If frontmatter
  has an "updated:" field, set it to {{TODAY}}.
- Output the COMPLETE merged note as raw Markdown ONLY — no code fences, no commentary.`
