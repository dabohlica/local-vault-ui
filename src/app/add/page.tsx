          Just write what you want to capture — a meeting, a person, a project update, an idea. The local
          model figures out where it belongs (a person note, a project page, today&rsquo;s daily note, a
          board…) and may create several notes at once. You review every change as a diff before anything
          is written. To add a file, drag &amp; drop it anywhere.
